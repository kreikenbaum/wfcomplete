To run: run python fextractor.py, compile flearner.cpp and run it. 

fextractor.py: Generates feature files from packet sequence files. Packet sequence files
are located in batch/ where each line is a time (float), then \t, then a positive or negative
number (postive: outgoing packet length or cell, negative: incoming packet length or cell).
Feature files are lists of features as defined by fextractor.py.

flearner.cpp: Learns distance weights and measures accuracy based on the distance weights.
Most interesting variables are near the top or the start of the main function. Accuracy output
as true positive rate and then false positive rate.
