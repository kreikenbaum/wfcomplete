<h1>Website Fingerprinting</h1>

<p>When browsing the web, many users would prefer to have privacy. 
Clients who wish to avoid behavorial marketing, tracking and 
surveillance could use an anonymizing proxy service such as Tor. Tor, 
however, is susceptible to <b>website fingerprinting</b>, wherein a 
local, passive adversary (such as your ISP or those who have access to 
your ISP's data) can identify a user's behavior according to patterns in
 their packet sequence.</p>

<p>We have implemented new and old website fingerprinting attacks and 
defenses, in order to demonstrate its realistic threat and defend 
against the it. We have five papers describing our research and 
implementations. DL indicates a direct link and L indicates a link to 
the entry in the relevant publisher. </p>

You may need to do some editing to get some defenses to work with 
different data sets (for example, changing the folder names in the 
code). Please feel free to e-mail Tao Wang's @uwaterloo.ca e-mail

<h3>Other Work:</h3>

<h4>Attacks:</h4>

These are our implementations of previously published attacks.
They all work with the standard format, where each line is
a (time \t packetsize) pair.

<br>

Some attacks require several files to work; for those, runattackname.sh
will run the attack.

For your convenience, we have a <a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/attacks.zip">single zip file</a> of all these attacks.


<h4>Defenses:</h4>

<p>We implemented these defenses. Some work by default with the traces we used for USENIX 2014 (below).</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/tdef.py">Traffic morphing (NDSS 2009)</a>: Works with TCP traces below.
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/hdef.py">HTTPOS split (NDSS 2011)</a>: Works with TCP traces below.
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/pdef.py">Decoy pages (WPES 2011)</a>: Works with cell traces below.
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/bdef.py">BuFLO (IEEE S&amp;P 2012)</a>: Works with cell traces below.
<br>

</blockquote>

<h3>Traces:</h3>

<p>We used these traces for our works; we do not have the traces of 
other authors. The file name is either a single number, or two numbers 
separated by a hyphen. In the latter case the first number represents a 
site, i.e. 39-40 and 39-20 come from the same site, but 39-40 and 59-40 
do not.</p>


<blockquote>

<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/levdata1.zip">Cai's traces, converted to cells (WPES 2013)</a>: 100 sites, 40 instances each. 
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/levdata2.zip">Traces (WPES 2013)</a>: 100 sites, 40 instances each. 
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/levdata3.zip">Traces for open world (WPES 2013)</a>: 5 sites, 40 instances each, plus 900 open world instances. 
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/knndata.zip">Cell traces (USENIX 2014)</a>: 100 sites, 90 instances each, plus 9000 open world instances. 
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/knntcpdata.zip">TCP traces (USENIX 2014)</a>: Lost when my hard disk burned out. Sorry. 
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/webfingerprint/walkie-data.zip">Cell traces </a>: Gathered under the walkie-talkie defense above.

</blockquote>


<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Suppose you wanted to test our kNN's performance against decoy pages 
on Tor. Download "Our kNN attack" under Attacks, "Decoy pages" under 
Defenses, and "Cell traces" under Data. Modify the cell traces with the 
defense (pdef.py), and then use the feature extractor (fextractor.py) in
 our kNN attack to generate feature files for the data. Finally, use our
 kNN (flearner.cpp) and get the accuracy. It will require some editing 
to get all of those files to work together with each other (e.g. edit 
the number of instances used, folder names).</p>
