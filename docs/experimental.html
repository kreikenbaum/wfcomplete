    <p><b>Updated 09/05/2011</b>: Add link to actual <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch">implementation patch</a> on gitweb<br>
<br></p>
<p>Website fingerprinting is the act of recognizing web traffic through 
surveillance despite the use of encryption or anonymizing software. The 
general idea is to leverage the fact that many web sites have specific 
fixed request patterns and response byte counts that are known 
beforehand. This information can be used to recognize your web traffic 
despite attempts at encryption or tunneling. Websites that have an 
abundance of static content and a fixed request structure tend to be  
vulnerable to this type of surveillance. Unfortunately, there is enough 
static content on most websites for this to be the case.</p>
<p><a href="http://guh.nu/projects/ta/safeweb/safeweb.pdf">Early work</a>
 was quick to determine that simple packet-based encryption schemes 
(such as wireless and/or VPN encryption) were insufficient to prevent 
recognition of traffic patterns created by popular websites in the 
encrypted stream. Later, a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/119060/WebAppSideChannel-final.pdf">small-scale study</a>
 determined that a lot of information could be extracted from HTTPS 
streams using these same approaches against specific websites.</p>
<p>Despite these early results, whenever researchers tried naively 
applying these techniques to Tor-like systems, they failed to come up 
with publishable results (meaning the attack did not work against Tor), 
due largely to the fixed 512 byte cell size, as well as the multiplexing
 of Tor client traffic over a single TLS connection.</p>
<p>However, last month, a group of researchers <a href="http://lorre.uni.lu/%7Eandriy/papers/acmccs-wpes11-fingerprinting.pdf">succeeded in performing this attack</a>
 where the others had failed. Their success hinged largely on their use 
of a simplified yet well-chosen feature set for training their 
classifiers. Where other researchers simply dumped packet sizes and 
timings into their classifiers and unsurprisingly got poor results 
against Tor traffic, this group extracted the time, quantity and 
direction of traffic, and discarded irrelevant control information such 
as TCP ACKs.</p>
<p>While the research methodology of the attack side of their work is 
particularly exemplary (certainly the most thorough study in website 
fingerprinting to date),  their results are still likely insufficient to
 deploy against the network and expect to catch people engaging in 
single visits of forbidden websites. For such a use case, even their 
relatively low false positive rate is going to cause a lot of issues 
when deployed against large quantities of traffic. Concurrent use of 
multiple AJAX-enabled websites and/or other applications will also 
frustrate an attacker. Even without concurrent activity, their 
"open-world" experiment (the most realistic scenario for dragnet 
surveillance of Tor traffic) shows true positive accuracy of around 55%.</p>
<p>However, repeated observations over long periods of time are likely 
sufficient to develop certainty. It is also possible that extracting 
actual application data lengths from Tor TLS headers would add 
additional accuracy.</p>
<p>Hence, this is a rather nasty attack. It is basically a one-ended 
version of the age-old end-to-end correlation attack (where an adversary
 attempts to observe both the entrance to the network and the exits to 
correlate traffic flows). With the website fingerprinting attack, the 
adversary only needs to observe a single entry (a bridge, a guard node, 
or a regional firewall) of the network to begin gathering information 
about users who use that entry point.</p>
<p>However, because the attack is only one-ended, many defenses that 
would be useless against the full end-to-end attack can be considered. 
In the countermeasures section of their paper, the researchers point out
 that a Firefox addon that simply performs background HTTP requests 
concurrent to normal user activity was enough to foil their classifier.</p>
<p>We disagree with the background fetch approach because it seems that a
 slightly more sophisticated attack would train a separate classifier to
 recognize the background cover traffic and then subtract it before 
attempting to classify the remainder. In the face of this concern, it 
seems that the background request defense is not worth the additional 
network load until it can be further studied in detail.</p>
<p>Instead, we are deploying an <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3914">experimental defense</a> in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-5">today's Tor Browser Bundle release</a>
 that is specifically designed to reduce the information available for 
feature extraction without adding overhead. The defense is to enable <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_pipelining">HTTP pipelining</a>, and to randomize the pipeline size as well as the order of requests. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch">source code to the implementation</a> can be viewed on gitweb.</p>
<p>Since normal, non-randomized pipelining is still off by default to 
this day in Firefox, we are assuming that the published attack results 
are against serialized request/response behavior, which provides 
significantly more feature information to the attacker. In particular, 
we believe a randomized pipeline will eliminate or reduce the utility of
 the 'Size Marker', 'Number Marker', 'Number of Packets', and 'Occurring
 Packet Sizes' features on sites that support pipelining, due to the 
batching of requests and responses of arbitrary sizes. More generally, 
the randomized pipeline should obscure the request vs response size and 
request ordering information available to the classifier. </p>
<p>Our hope is that the randomized pipeline defense will therefore 
increase the duration of observation required to establish certainty 
that a site is being visited, by lowering the true positive rate and/or 
raising the false positive rate beyond what the researchers observed.</p>
<p>We do not expect this defense to be foolproof. We create it as a 
prototype, and request that future research papers do not treat the 
defense as if it were the final solution against website fingerprinting 
of Tor traffic. In particular, not all websites support pipelining (in 
fact, an unknown number may deliberately disable it to reduce load), and
 even those that do will still leak the initial response size as well as
 the total response size to the attacker. Pipelining may also be 
disabled by malicious or simply misconfigured exits.</p>
<p>However, the defense could also be improved. We did not attempt to 
determine the optimal pipeline size or distribution, and are relying on 
the research community to tweak these parameters as they evaluate the 
defense.</p>
<p>We could also take more extreme measures, such as building pipelining
 support into Tor exit nodes. Perhaps better still, we could deploy an <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/ideas/xxx-using-spdy.txt">HTTP to SPDY translation service at exits</a>. The more efficient request bundling of <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/spdy">SPDY</a>
 would likely obscure request vs response size information yet further. 
However, as these translations are potentially fragile as well as 
labor-intensive to implement and deploy, we are unlikely to take these 
measures without further feedback from and study by the research 
community.</p>
<p>Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, defenses could be deployed at the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/protocol-spec.txt">obfsproxy plugin layer</a>. Defenses there would not help against an adversary at the bridge or guard node, but would help against regional firewalls.</p>
<p>We would love to hear feedback from the research community about 
these approaches, and look forward to hearing more results of future 
attack and defense work along these and other avenues.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Right now, Tor basically tries to keep using
 the same circuit for the same ports for 10 minutes. This should mean 
that a website should have all of its 3rd party content loaded over the 
same circuit, but it is not ensured.</p>
<p>Our plan is to ensure that each top-level urlbar domain has all of 
the third party content go through a single circuit, but that fresh 
circuits will be used for new urlbar domains: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455" rel="nofollow">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3455</a></p>
<p>This circuit isolation property is intended to reduce linkability between different site activity by exit nodes.</p>
<p>This means that if you are using concurrent activity as a defense, 
you have a 1/3 chance (roughly) of that concurrent activity actually 
using a different guard node than the one that might be targeting you.</p>
<p>Sending third party content down a different circuit is possible, I 
suppose, but I worry if we do it deliberately, things may break. It will
 also consume a lot of relay CPU resources for excess circuit 
creation...</p>

<p>For example, let's say <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" title="www.torproject.org">www.torproject.org</a> has 15 images, and supports pipelining. The request processing looks like this:</p>
<p><code></code></p><code>
<pre>client: 
  "GET /"
server: 
  "&lt;html&gt;&lt;img&gt;*15&lt;/html&gt;"

client:

  Compute random integer P from 4..12
  Choose a random subset of P of the remaining images    
  Issue pipelined GET requests for this subset
</pre></code><p><code></code></p>
<p><br><br>
As you can see, a new random number P is chosen <b><i>for each batch of requests</i></b>.
 It is not a property of either Jack or Jill's computer. It does not 
persist. The sequence of P's come from the NSS cryptographically secure 
random number generator via PK11_GenerateRandom().</p>

    <div class="content"><p>&gt;The pipeline size is randomized for each batch of requests.</p>
<p>Yes, I had this assumption. </p>
<p>Theoretical case:<br>
Jill's ISP records her traffic. Jill visits www.truenews.blog, an 
unconvenient service for some and therefore all its traffic is watched. 
The site uses common blog software with rotating images making a 
correlation by image byte size uncertain.</p>
<p>Jill gets questioned later and claims she had visited some other site
 instead. Jill's browser used 3 pipelines (3-5-2) for the 10 images on 
the front page. The other 4 Tor visistors at the time had different 
pipeline patterns.</p>
<p>After Jill had read 5 pages at www.truenews.blog both ISPs have 
recorded a distinct pipeline request pattern (3-5-2) (6-2-2) (8-2) 
(2-3-2-3) (4-2-4).</p>
<p>I think it could be rather convincing to show Jill had indeed visited
 that blog and rather difficult for Jill to deny it because of the 
uniqueness of the pattern chain. </p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>You're basically describing an end-to-end 
correlation attack against a specific, targeted user. This is not a 
survivable scenario with or without this patch. The traffic timing 
information from the combination of the surveilling local ISP and the 
surveilled blog will be more than enough to doom Jill, regardless of her
 custom request pattern.</p>
<p>I guess you are arguing that while improving against the one-ended 
attack, this defense makes the two-ended attack worse as a tradeoff, and
 that this tradeoff is bad. However, the two-ended attack is really bad 
already anyway because it gets to use inter-packet timings, connection 
hiccups, and even active traffic shaping, especially when targeted 
against specific sites and users. </p>
<p>If we're not talking about actual packet captures at the blog and 
instead just subpoenaed logs, normal apache logs don't log pipelining 
status, so that may also be a slightly different story...</p>
<p>The rabbit hole goes pretty deep in terms of tradeoffs and actual 
threat under different levels of observation detail, but once you start 
talking about surveillance at both ends, the current understanding in 
the research community is that it is game over. This assumption may in 
fact be wrong, though. For an amusing breakdown of the difference 
between a dragnet global vs targeting adversary, see: <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html" rel="nofollow">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html</a></p>

    <div class="content"><p>What does OnionCoffee and/or Prime-Project have to do with this?</p>
<p>The research community explored this topic because understanding how 
the attack might work in practice is essential to developing a proper 
defense for it. This is how scientific security research works.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the paper authored by the researchers was 
significantly more rigorous in its analysis of the attack side as 
opposed to developing proper defenses. We believe the defense provided 
by the researchers doesn't seem like it will stand up to a more 
sophisticated attack, and will just waste network resources. We believe 
this because there is a history of failures of background cover traffic 
in the academic literature. The basic stuff definitely doesn't work, and
 even the complex schemes are regarded as questionable.</p>
<p>Hence, we are deploying an alternate defense that we feel might perform better at no cost to the network.</p>
<p>It is possible that our defense won't stand up either. This is 
unfortunately the nature of science: We must explore attacks and 
defenses and deploy only those that we expect to stand to further 
scrutiny. Sometimes we are wrong, and we must rethink the defense or 
improve it. This blog post was primarily about properly communicating to
 the research community why we chose the defense we did, and how they 
might best study it and defenses like it.</p>
<p>If you disagree with our reasoning, you are of course free to deploy 
the defense suggested by the researchers in combination. Just keep 
browser tabs open to few pages that have refresh timers (for example, 
many news sites that update with new headlines, and also twitter). This 
will basically be equivalent the defense the researchers suggested.</p>
<p>However, until more research is done, neither of us can be 100% sure

    <div class="content"><p>Sorry for answering late but I'm on the 
move. 1st) To your first question: Andriy Panchenko, who did/supervise 
the job, had worked in OnionCoffee and Prime. The same for other signing
 the paper. U can see it here: http://lorre.uni.lu/~andriy/  2nd) The 
defense Andriy propose is too simple and inneficcient (preparing a new 
addons?), but leads you to pipelining. So, he's done.It makes u change. 
3rd) I'm talking to you coz YOU must try to "prevent" before and not 
"react" against attacks. Users must believe u when u talk/write, not 
when u react. Web Fingerprinting is as old as grandma. What were u doing
 all this years? 4th) I can work with Pipelining just from about:config 
and a few extra touchs. This is years old.. No ofense. Just thoughts to 
improve prevention. </p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>1. Ok.<br>
2. Ok.<br>
3. We can't make defenses against imaginary attacks. The exact 
mechanisms of how the attack might work were not successfully 
demonstrated until Panchenko published. I guess you didn't manage to 
make it to paragraph #3, where I said that every other research group 
that tried this attack against Tor failed to produce results?<br>
4. The original about:config options for pipelining don't allow the randomization we implemented.<br>
5. We implemented the randomization specifically because we finally had a
 proven, published, and peer-reviewed attack mechanism that described 
and demonstrated exactly what information the attack needed to succeed. 
We did not have this before. All we had was speculation. It was exactly 
the attack setup information published by Panchenko that led us to 
decide on randomized pipelining as a plausible defense (see the 
paragraph in the blog about the feature-set used and which ones we 
expect to disable).<br>
6. No offense, but you appear to be a troll. You might want to have that looked at by a professional.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In this context, I think "prevention" is the
 use of all types of imaginary attacks. BTW, what would you do if 
Panchenko didn't publish a thing ? How would you know what to do ? 
Remember Web Fingerprinting isn't new. Just try to prevent. I know isn't
 easy. But let all Tor's users be sure that you are thinking in the 
future, not changing versions when some new attack come into sight. 
Users must trust in Tor. Trust is everything in privacy. I believe in 
it. </p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>If Panchencho didn't publish, we would 
probably set our packet size to a fixed amount (say, 512 bytes), and 
multiplex all of the client data on a single TLS stream. This should 
provide some obfuscation for most protocols (remember, Tor supports more
 than just HTTP) without too much overhead, complexity or 
protocol-specific craziness. Oh wait, we did that. And it did. For a 
decade.</p>
<p>We want the trust in Tor to come from the fact that we are open 
source and transparent, and that we do Real Science. Everything in Tor 
is built upon decades of public research. We don't want trust in Tor to 
come from us doing secret defenses and looking into a crystal ball and 
guessing what the most devastating imaginary attacks might be, and 
developing broken pretend defenses against imaginary attacks that 
probably don't work in reality. </p>
<p>There are plenty of other tools that will sell you magical secret 
sauce to defend against everything from the future and beyond. We don't 
do that, because there's another name for that magical secret sauce: 
Snake Oil.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>From the little research I've done, this sounds to me like the right approach.</p>
<p>The defense suggested in the paper is useless against future (better accuracy) attacks. Sounds cosmetic, really.</p>
<p>Shorter, self-similar (i.e. either constant, or resembling white 
noise -- no in-between) bursts of traffic will degrade accuracy of 
classifiers very quickly. Pipelining will do this. However, the more 
information passed in any session, the worse off Tor is in terms of 
defenses against future attacks. For example, I would *not* chose this 
approach for instant messaging. There, constant cover traffic (say, 
bursts every second) is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p></div>
